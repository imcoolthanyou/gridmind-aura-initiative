# For mobile device access during development:
# 1. Find your machine's IP address:
#    - Windows: Open Command Prompt and run 'ipconfig'
#    - Mac/Linux: Open Terminal and run 'ifconfig'
# 2. Look for your WiFi adapter's IPv4 address (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)
# 3. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL to that IP address with port 3000

# Example (replace with your actual IP):
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://192.168.56.1:3000

# Uncomment and set your IP address below:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000
